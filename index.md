# Welcome to My projects page

On this website I will mention about upcoming projects and where you can find them and where you can sign up to help if the option is avalible for that project. 


### Website development
I Have rencently discorvered that making websites like this one is something that interests me. I am not writting the HTML code for these webpages, I am simply using [Github styling](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). From time to time i do like to write HTML code my self and then use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for my hosting of the web pages, that is how this website is hosted. Here is a little look at some of the code behind this page.
