# Welcome to My projects page

On this website I will mention about upcoming projects and where you can find them and where you can sign up to help if the option is available for that project. 


## Website development
I have recently discovered that making websites like this one is something that interests me. I am not writing the HTML code for these webpages; I am simply using [GitHub styling](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). From time to time I do like to write HTML code myself and then use [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) for my hosting of the web pages, that is how this website is hosted. Here is a little look at some of the code behind this page.

## 3D Printing
So recently for Christmas my parents gave me a 3D printer ([Ender 3 Pro](https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/618A-KYHF1L.jpg)) and my brother got me some filament. After setting it up and printing the [Benchy](https://cdn.thingiverse.com/renders/62/ab/d7/e3/ea/1_3D-printed_3DBenchy_by_Creative-Tools.com_preview_featured.JPG) stress test to make sure that everything is running correctly I started doing some prints (2 so far). Below are some photos of those prints. 

### Flexi Cat
This Print is called "Felxi cat" Which can be found on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:3576952). I think of this print as a way to show off how cool print in place moving parts are. [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vK3fUMEQAeU) is an example of how the Flexi cat is supposed to work. When my flexi cat was being [sliced](https://libguides.ecu.edu/c.php?g=154937&p=6016326) it was scaled down by 50% to shorten the print time and use less filament. By having the print on scaled at 50% the hinges got fused (or stuck) together, Which kinda sucks.

### Screwless Filament Feeder
This print is called "[Screwless Filament Feeder](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:1750875)" by [DarthxRinzler](https://www.thingiverse.com/DarthxRinzler). This print is used as a hole in the side of a [Dry box](https://3dprinting.com/how-to/filament-storage-3d-printing-guide/). Basically it allows you to store the filament in a dry place to stop the filament from absorbing moisture from the surrounding air while still being able to print. The above link explains how a dry box works and why they are important.
